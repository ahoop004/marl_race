# Circle race with randomized MPC traffic

Scenario settings are now inline. Select parameter choices in the canonical YAML
file or use `--set KEY=YAML`; there are no scenario inheritance files in `configs`.

Train:

```bash
venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/ppo_1v1_racing_mpc_circle.yaml \
  --set 'environment.spawn.policy="centerline_random"' \
  --set environment.spawn.centerline.min_distance=2.0 \

Add `--render` to view training. The PPO learner is blue, its designated racing
MPC opponent (`car_1`) is red, and five background traffic cars are gray:
kinematic MPC, obstacle-aware MPC, defensive MPC, CBF MPC, and MPCC.
Their controller types and speed ranges are configured per car in the scenario.

Every episode independently samples all seven cars' positions around the entire
circle, including the opponent. Sampling is uniform by centerline arc length,
with at least 2 m between car centres. A fixed reset seed reproduces the grid;
evaluation also uses randomized grids determined by its evaluation seeds.
The traffic count and controller mix are fixed; the positions and ordering vary.

The pretrained checkpoint, observation, reward, and learning settings are configured in
`ppo_1v1_racing_mpc_circle.yaml`. Training and evaluation have no lap limit;
evaluation retains its 120,000-step safety cap. Only `car_1` is the reward target. Background
traffic laps and crashes do not produce finish events or crash bonuses.

Any ego collision or boundary violation ends the episode. Fixed cars recover
from wall, boundary, or fixed-car collisions on the centerline while preserving
lap counts and episode time. The target's recovery still earns the original
+1 bonus, unless ego also crashes that step. Traffic-only recoveries earn no
bonus. Ego sees traffic through its existing LiDAR observation. Five extra inputs
always describe its configured target (`car_1`), regardless of which traffic car
is closest. The observation has 163 inputs; pretrained actor/critic input layers
are expanded with zero new columns, preserving initial behavior.

The traffic MPC geometry and kinematic rollouts use cached Numba kernels.
The first use can include compilation time; subsequent decisions use the
compiled code. Candidate counts, planning horizons, and control frequency are
unchanged. Kinematic MPC applies previous-action smoothness in a single search.

Measure controller and physics costs without PPO, rendering, or experiment
logging:

```bash
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 venv/bin/python scripts/benchmark_mpc_traffic.py --traffic --steps 16
```

This benchmark holds ego stationary and excludes the first two decisions from
timing. It reports per-controller times and action/pose hashes for comparisons
across revisions; it does not measure end-to-end training throughput.
It uses the canonical 1v1 scenario with traffic overrides; omit `--traffic` to
measure the plain 1v1 setup.

The [recorded comparison](benchmarks/mpc_traffic_optimization.json) on a Xeon
Silver 4214 measured 2.64 s/step before and 0.48 s/step after (5.5x faster), with
identical action and pose hashes. This is one 16-step sample after warmup, using
seed 42 and a 10 m/s racing-opponent limit; timings vary with traffic and hardware.

A [second optimization pass](benchmarks/mpc_traffic_optimization_round2.json)
shares the nearest-centerline search across path, heading, and progress costs,
and removes temporary prediction arrays from racing MPC objective evaluations.
Across seeds 42–44 with 32 measured decisions per seed, controller/physics time
fell from 444 to 275 ms/step (another 1.6x). The plain 1v1 scenario improved from
24.1 to 22.5 ms/step in the same short benchmark. Action and pose hashes matched
for all six before/after comparisons; controller settings are unchanged.

These recorded timings predate the MF6.1 racing prediction model. The allocation
optimizations have been carried forward to its eight-state midpoint integrator,
including its steering limits and grip costs. Re-run the benchmark to measure
performance with the current model; the historical timings are not current results.

For parallel training, add `--num-envs 8 --no-render` to the training command.
With the current pooled `n_steps: 1024`, eight workers collect 128 decisions each
per PPO update. Benchmark worker counts on the training machine; the scenario
keeps its existing training and evaluation settings.
