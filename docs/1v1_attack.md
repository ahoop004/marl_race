# Matched 1v1 attack training

`scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack.yaml` fine-tunes the full pretrained actor.
`scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack_lora.yaml` freezes that actor and trains rank-4 LoRA
adapters plus the exploration parameters. Both train a fresh centralized critic
and use the same single-learner MAPPO implementation, fixed racing MPC target,
maps, seeds, rewards, limits and collection/evaluation budgets.

Both initialize the actor from `outputs/pretrain/best_model2.pt`. The original
PPO critic is not transferred because MAPPO's critic consumes the joint state.
The default training budget is 20 million joint decisions. Training and evaluation
episodes end when the learner completes five laps, on ego collision or boundary
exit, or at 40,000 physics steps, whichever comes first. Only `car_0` finishes on
laps; the MPC target keeps driving and respawning even after its own fifth lap.

Both scenarios use:

```yaml
environment:
  max_steps: 40000
  target_laps: 5
  episode_termination:
    mode: all_trainable
    lap_completion: true
    lap_finish_agents: [car_0]
evaluation:
  max_steps: 40000
  target_laps: 5
  lap_completion: true
```

Rollout boundaries still trigger learning updates during an episode. After an
episode ends, collection resets and continues until `experiment.total_steps`.
Final evaluation inherits the same lap/time settings unless explicitly overridden.
At the 0.05 s timestep, the limit is 2,000 simulated seconds (33 min 20 s).
Spa is the longest selected centerline at approximately 554 m: five laps take
about 1,386 s at an average 2 m/s. Even allowing up to one additional lap to
reach the initial finish crossing leaves over five minutes for slower maneuvers.
The limit also bounds episodes where the learner stops making lap progress.

```bash
venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack.yaml --no-wandb
venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack_lora.yaml --no-wandb
```

For parallel collection, add `--num-envs 8` (and optionally
`--set experiment.num_workers=4`). Both arms use the same
`training_defaults.rollout_steps_per_env: 256` in parallel mode. Use the same
collection settings and seeds for both arms. This does not reproduce the serial
rollout size, so compare runs within the same collection protocol.

For render profiling, MPC optimizations and a 128-core launch/benchmark recipe,
see [the 1v1 performance review](1v1_mpc_performance.md).

### HPC training and checkpoint evaluation

On one GPU in an allocated compute session, this starts 400 environments grouped
into 100 CPU worker processes:

```bash
python3 -u run.py --scenario scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack.yaml \
  --num-envs 400 --num-workers 100 --torch-threads 1 \
  --collector-scheduling ready \
  --set evaluation.every_steps=2048000 --no-render
```

Use the same settings for the LoRA arm. `ready` serves training workers as they
finish their MPC solves instead of waiting at every action barrier. Weights
remain fixed until the collection round ends. Scheduling changes stochastic
action ordering; benchmark it against `synchronous` on the allocated node.

Check the startup CPU-affinity line before interpreting the worker count. An
allocation of 128 logical CPUs may provide only 64 physical cores with two
hardware threads each. The startup report reads Linux topology when available;
it does not infer physical cores from CPU numbering. A shell inside an allocated
Open OnDemand/Apptainer session can launch these workers directly. Each worker
steps its assigned environments sequentially, and the parent handles policy
inference and updates on one device. A second GPU is not used by this collector.

For a short worker-count comparison on that allocation, run this while the
training job is stopped so the two runs do not compete for resources:

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmark_collectors.py \
  --scenario scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack.yaml \
  --num-envs 400 --workers 64 80 100 --scheduling ready \
  --rollout-steps-per-env 256 --total-steps 307200 \
  --set evaluation.enabled=false
```

This runs three updates per setting, excludes the first from steady rates, and
writes each result to its own run directory. Compare `round_steps_per_second`;
repeat promising settings before a long run. The learning parameters and total
work are matched, but stochastic trajectories can differ between worker layouts.
Restore evaluation for the actual training experiment. This comparison tests
whether fewer processes help; it does not assume that 64 workers are faster.

Both attack scenarios set `evaluation.num_workers: auto`. For checkpoint
selection this uses at most eight workers, capped by episode count and the
training worker/environment counts. Thus the command above runs all eight
evaluation races concurrently, while local one-environment training evaluates
serially. Set `--set evaluation.num_workers=1` for a serial comparison, or use
an explicit positive count. The startup line reports the resolved worker count.
Evaluation heartbeats include `workers` and the number of completed episodes.

Evaluation workers own only CPU simulation and MPC. The parent keeps the GPU
actor and serves each race with the same inference batch shape as serial
evaluation. Workers persist across checkpoint evaluations, so process startup
and first-use compilation affect the first evaluation most. Training workers
wait during evaluation. The longest race still determines when evaluation can
finish; eight workers cannot shorten one individual 40,000-step race.

The eight maps, seeds, five-lap target, 40,000-step limit and selection score
remain the same. Round-robin spawn positions now use the global episode index,
independent of worker assignment and earlier evaluations. This fixes the old
serial evaluator's advancing spawn cursor. Checkpoint evaluation histories identify this as
`spawn_schedule: episode_index_v1`; repeated evaluations now replay the same
starts. Earlier evaluations that used the drifting cursor are not identical
trials. Training spawn sampling is unaffected.

Trajectory recording and rendering retain serial evaluation because those
adapters are bound to one environment; requesting parallel workers prints a
warning when falling back. Standalone `--eval` also retains its existing serial
execution and reward/recording report. The worker setting applies to checkpoint
selection during fixed-opponent MAPPO training.

With 400 environments and horizon 256, each update follows 102,400 joint
decisions. The command above evaluates every 20 rounds. Increasing the cadence
interval reduces the number of evaluations, not each evaluation's duration, and
changes which checkpoints are eligible for selection. Compare
`perf/collection_seconds`, `perf/update_seconds`, and `eval/evaluation_seconds`
separately; collection/round throughput excludes evaluation hook time.

Training heartbeats now include live `collected` and `collect_steps/s` counters;
`env_steps` still changes only at completed updates. Each update prints collection,
optimization and parent inference/wait timings. Fewer completed episodes alone
do not establish a slowdown: at 1,600 aggregate decisions/s, 400 environments
average four decisions/s each, and long races finish much less often. See
[collector timing definitions](COLLECTOR_PERFORMANCE.md#distinguishing-a-slow-rollout-from-a-stalled-hpc-job).

Attack clearance checks also use a compiled exact wall-segment search to avoid
large temporary arrays per footprint corner. Physics, MPC solver budgets and
the geometry used by rewards are unchanged. For a controlled training throughput
comparison, use `scripts/benchmark_collectors.py` with evaluation disabled;
restore evaluation for the training experiment.

Measure checkpoint evaluation separately on the allocated node:

```bash
python3 scripts/benchmark_mappo_evaluation.py \
  --scenario scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack.yaml \
  --workers 1 8 --max-steps 128 --repetitions 2 \
  --output /tmp/attack_eval_benchmark.json
```

This uses the configured pretrained actor; `--checkpoint /path/to/model.pt`
instead measures a trained MAPPO checkpoint. It runs one cold evaluation and two
warm evaluations per worker count. The shortened cap is for timing only; these
scores must not replace the five-lap selection protocol.

A [local September 30 probe](benchmarks/1v1_parallel_evaluation.json) used all
eight maps, the real pretrained actor and a Quadro RTX 5000. Each evaluation
completed 781 physics steps under the 128-step cap:

| Evaluation workers | First evaluation | Mean of two warm evaluations |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 48.53 s | 47.46 s |
| 8 | 13.49 s | 8.64 s |

All six evaluation summaries matched exactly. The approximately 5.5× warm
speedup is a bounded local result, not an HPC or full-race prediction. Separate
alternating 200-step controller/environment probes improved from 27.3 to 32.1
decisions/s after the exact wall-distance optimization (about 18%), with matching
action and simulator-state hashes. Those probes exclude policy inference,
optimization and evaluation; measure end-to-end training on the HPC.

A separate small training check (eight environments, four workers, three
64-step rounds, one repetition per scheduler) measured 37.5 decisions/s with
`synchronous` and 56.3 with `ready`, including optimizer time and excluding the
first round. Whole-process times were 50.0 s and 38.9 s. This supports trying
`ready` for the MPC workload, but different action-draw ordering means these are
equal work budgets rather than identical trajectories or learning comparisons.

Evaluate with the corresponding scenario and saved checkpoint:

```bash
venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack_lora.yaml \
  --eval --checkpoint outputs/YOUR_RUN/best_model.pt --eval-episodes 8 --no-wandb
```

Saved checkpoints include the actor base and adapters; evaluation does not need
the original pretraining file. Add `--render` to visualize either arm locally.

## Default vehicle and command limits

The simulator applies one shared vehicle model, footprint, mass, tire model,
friction draw and actuator configuration to both cars. These remain compatible
with the pretrained checkpoint.

| Quantity | Ego and MPC target |
|---|---|
| Forward rolling-speed reference | 0–5 m/s |
| Rolling-speed reference acceleration / braking | −5 to +5 m/s² |
| Wheel-speed reference used while driving | 0–100 rad/s |
| Wheel-reference acceleration / braking | −100 to +100 rad/s² |
| Steering reference and physical angle bounds | −0.4189 to +0.4189 rad |
| Physical steering rate bounds | −3.2 to +3.2 rad/s |
| Physical wheel actuator rate bounds | −10,000 to +10,000 rad/s² |
| Steering / wheel actuator time constants | 0.5 s / 0.15 s |
| Physics and decision interval | 0.05 s |
| Wheel radius | 0.05 m |

The MPC's `max_acceleration: 5` limits both acceleration and braking symmetrically;
its optimization bounds prohibit negative speed references. The ego integrates
its action with `max_wheel_acceleration: 100`, `max_wheel_deceleration: 100` and
`prevent_reverse: true`. These are the same limits after multiplying by wheel radius.

The MPC's extra steering-reference smoother is set to 17 rad/s, exceeding the
entire allowed reference span per decision (16.756 rad/s). This makes it
nonbinding, matching the pretrained ego's ability to request any allowed angle
each decision. Both physical steering actuators still obey the same ±3.2 rad/s
bound and lag. These matching command limits are scenario defaults; validation
also accepts independently configured limits and supported action settings.

The shared underlying wheel model retains its pretrained −400 rad/s lower
bound, but both controllers restrict **commands** to nonnegative wheel speeds.
These are rolling-reference bounds, not clamps on measured chassis velocity or
acceleration: tire slip and actuator response determine actual motion. Changing
physics/action limits requires a compatible source checkpoint.

Change parameters in YAML or with `--set KEY=YAML`, for example:

```bash
venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack.yaml \
  --set agents.car_1.params.max_speed=4.2 \
  --set agents.car_1.params.max_acceleration=3.0 \
  --set agents.car_1.params.max_steering_reference_rate=1.5
```

`--max-speed VALUE` accepts any positive finite speed in m/s and sets the shared
vehicle wheel-speed ceiling plus every MPC's forward limit. For independent
limits, omit this flag and leave `environment.max_speed` unset (or remove it with
`--set environment.max_speed=!delete`). Physical wheel bounds still constrain
controller commands. Numeric validity, supported task structure and checkpoint
compatibility are still checked.

## Observations and transfer

The original 158 inputs are retained exactly: 108 normalized LiDAR beams and
50 vehicle/track Frenet values. Five inputs are appended in this order:
`delta_s`, `delta_d`, `delta_vs`, `delta_vd`, `present`, with fixed scales
30 m, 5 m, 20 m/s, 20 m/s and 1. Target sensing uses simulator state, including
outside LiDAR range. `delta_s` is signed shortest wrapped track distance.

The first actor layer gains five zero columns. All original actor parameters
are copied from the source. LoRA residuals initially contribute zero, so both
arms start with the same action distribution for the same driving observations.
The LoRA base's new zero columns remain frozen; its first-layer adapter learns
to use the target inputs. Both critics train on the same joint-state contract.

## Crash events and target respawning

The episode starts at a random track location, with both cars stationary and
the target approximately 3 m ahead. A target wall collision or boundary exit
causes an immediate target-only respawn, uniformly sampling forward arc gaps
from 3 to 10 m and rejecting candidates without vehicle/wall clearance. The
target is track-aligned and restarts at 2 m/s. Ego state and ongoing episode
progress are preserved. The controller plan, collision memory and target
progress tracker are reset; relocation earns no distance or lap progress.

All gaps must remain below half the track length, including across the finish
seam, so the actual target-relative observation reports a positive forward gap.
Nearest-centerline recovery in existing scenarios is unchanged.

Ego collision or boundary exit ends the episode. Contact between the cars
normally produces a mutual collision in this simulator; this task therefore
encourages forcing errors through positioning and pressure. A mutual crash is
never an attack success.

For credit, ego must have been moving forward faster than 0.5 m/s and within
3 m of the target in relative Frenet distance during the preceding second.
Ego must then survive for another 0.5 s after the target crash. Every qualifying
crash can earn credit, including multiple crashes within one episode. Pending
credit is cancelled by ego failure and is not carried across episode resets;
credit still pending when the episode ends is unawarded. Recent proximity is an
interaction proxy, not proof of causation.

## Reward and checkpoint selection

- Confirmed attack success: +10.
- Ego collision or boundary exit: −20, including mutual crashes.
- Signed approach-distance change: weight 0.1, capped at ±1 m per step.
- Signed change in the target's normalized distance from track center while
  nearby: weight 0.5.
- Signed ego distance progress: 0.01 per metre.

Approach/edge history resets at crashes so teleportation creates no shaping
bonus. Neither staying near the target nor remaining parked earns a standing
proximity bonus. The legacy once-per-episode crash rewards are not used.

Evaluation records raw target crashes, eligible crashes, survival-qualified
successes, successes per simulated minute, and ego crash rate (including
boundary exits). The primary checkpoint score is
`(successes - 2 * ego_failures) / scheduled_evaluation_minutes`, where each episode
contributes its full 2,000-second budget, including episodes that end early by
finishing five laps or by failing. An early ego crash keeps its full scheduled
time budget in that denominator, so early termination cannot inflate the primary
score. Ties prefer fewer ego
failures, then successes per actual simulated minute, then earned progress.
The failure weight matches the 20:10 terminal reward ratio.

Reports and checkpoint metadata label this score with
`attack_score_basis: scheduled_minutes` because the finite step limit takes
precedence for score normalization. Configurations with `max_steps: 0` and lap
completion enabled remain supported and use `scheduled_laps` instead. These
two score units should not be compared directly.

Evaluate the unadapted policy and target's ordinary driving as baselines before
interpreting increased target crashes as effective attacks. The setup and smoke
tests establish correct execution; attack effectiveness needs training and
held-out evaluation.
