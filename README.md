# F110_MARL

Scenario settings are now inline. Select parameter choices in the canonical YAML
file or use `--set KEY=YAML`; there are no scenario inheritance files in `configs`.

Pure PyTorch PPO and MAPPO experiments for F1TENTH racing. The repository supports
single-agent learning against fixed controllers, multi-agent learning with a
shared or independent actors and a centralized critic, checkpoint evaluation, and offline datasets.

## Run an experiment

Use the project virtual environment when available. Install with
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`; this uses the runtime and development
dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`. Development checks use pytest. Headless
examples:

```bash
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/legacy/ppo.yaml --no-wandb --episodes 1
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/legacy/mappo_gaplock.yaml --no-wandb --episodes 1
```

Logging uses compact task metrics by default. See [metrics logging](docs/metrics_logging.md)
for debug dashboards, local CSV exports, and buffering controls.

Use `--seed` for repeatability, `--output-dir` for a specific output location,
`--dataset-dir` for transition recording, and `--render` for local visualization.
PPO and MAPPO support `experiment.total_steps` or `--total-steps N` for an
aggregate environment-decision budget, and `--episodes N` for an episode budget.
An explicit `--episodes` removes the configured step budget; the two CLI budget
options are mutually exclusive. For MAPPO, one joint race decision counts once,
while individual learner samples are tracked separately.
W&B is optional and `--no-wandb` overrides scenario logging settings.

Matched 1v1 attack fine-tuning and LoRA scenarios are available as
`scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack.yaml` and `scenarios/mappo_1v1_attack_lora.yaml`.
Both load `outputs/pretrain/best_model2.pt`, default to equal vehicle/command limits,
and respawn crashed targets ahead of the surviving attacker. See
[the attack setup](docs/1v1_attack.md) for commands and task/evaluation semantics.

Independent passing and defending LoRA scenarios are available as
`scenarios/mappo_1v1_pass_lora.yaml` and `scenarios/mappo_1v1_defend_lora.yaml`.
They train against racing MPC with automatic circle-to-eight-map curricula and
require paired solo lap retention for checkpoint selection. See
[skill adapter training](docs/skill_adapters.md) for tasks, evaluation and smoke runs.
Skill LoRA evaluation supports a shared CPU worker pool across curriculum stages,
frozen-baseline comparisons, and solo retention. See the
[HPC resource and benchmark guide](docs/skill_adapters.md#parallel-evaluation-and-hpc-resources).

Use `--max-speed VALUE` with any positive finite value to give learners and MPCs
a shared forward speed limit in m/s. The equivalent YAML setting is
`environment.max_speed: 10`, also available as `--set environment.max_speed=10`.
The dedicated flag takes precedence, and the shared setting overrides individual
vehicle and MPC forward limits. Omitting it preserves existing limits.
At the current 0.05 m wheel radius, `--max-speed 7.5` sets the wheel-speed
ceiling to 150 rad/s. They limit rolling-speed commands; actual chassis
speed depends on slip and actuator response, and MPC slows for corners.

Checkpoint loading requires matching vehicle/action bounds. Use a checkpoint
trained at the selected speed, or start PPO from scratch:

```bash
venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/ppo_1v1_racing_mpc_circle.yaml \
  --max-speed 15 --set experiment.checkpoint=null --no-render
```

For MAPPO scratch runs, also clear `training_defaults.pretrained_actor_checkpoint`
and any LoRA configuration. Reverse bounds, acceleration limits and observation
scales are unchanged by the shared speed setting.

Evaluate a checkpoint with the same scenario and experiment overrides used for
training (the resolved configuration is checked against checkpoint provenance):

```bash
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/legacy/ppo.yaml --no-wandb --episodes 1 --eval --checkpoint outputs/example/checkpoint_ep000000.pt --eval-episodes 5
```

Replace the example checkpoint path with the checkpoint produced by your run.
`--allow-provenance-mismatch` is available for intentional cross-scenario evaluation.
For fixed-controller-only scenarios, use the ordinary episode command without
`--eval` or a checkpoint.

### Load the best PPO model on another track

`--checkpoint` accepts a checkpoint file or a source run directory containing
`best_model.pt`. With PPO training, it loads the actor and critic and starts a
new optimizer, learning-rate schedule, and episode budget using the destination
scenario. This is fine-tuning, not an exact interrupted-run resume. The source
path and SHA-256 are recorded in run/checkpoint provenance. Use a new output
directory; reusing the source checkpoint directory is rejected.

You can also set the path in the scenario YAML for training or `--eval`:

```yaml
experiment:
  checkpoint: ../outputs/ppo_lap_completion_pretrain/YOUR_RUN/best_model.pt
```

YAML paths are relative to the scenario directory; absolute paths and run
directories also work. `--checkpoint` overrides this field and remains relative
to the working directory. Leave `checkpoint: null` to disable YAML loading.

`scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_transfer.yaml` contains the pretraining observation,
reward, action, and network settings and selects circle_map. It uses a constant
1e-4 learning rate and a matched 4,096,000-transition destination budget. To use another track,
copy it, change its experiment name, and update all three map bundle lists.
First evaluate the original policy, then fine-tune, then evaluate the new policy:

```bash
# Replace outputs/PRETRAIN_RUN with the directory containing your best_model.pt.
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_transfer.yaml --eval --checkpoint outputs/PRETRAIN_RUN --allow-provenance-mismatch --eval-protocol final --output-dir outputs/circle_before --no-wandb
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_transfer.yaml --checkpoint outputs/PRETRAIN_RUN --output-dir outputs/circle_finetune --no-wandb
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_transfer.yaml --eval --checkpoint outputs/circle_finetune --eval-protocol final --output-dir outputs/circle_after --no-wandb
```

Compare `evaluation_report.json` in the before/after directories for completion,
collisions, progress, and finish times under the same final-test seeds and horizon.
The initial evaluation measures transfer without further learning; after fine-tuning,
the destination track is part of training. Keep final-test results out of checkpoint
selection. Omit `--checkpoint` and leave `experiment.checkpoint: null` for a matched
from-scratch baseline. Both fine-tuning and scratch arms use the same destination learning rate and budget.
Network dimensions, activation, and physical action contracts must match the source;
keep observation component meanings/order compatible as well as their dimensions.

## Experiment catalog

The active scenarios share the current MF6.1 physics and driving observation.
See [the scenario index](scenarios/README.md) for the retained historical files.

| Workflow | Scenario under `scenarios/` |

| PPO local/HPC pretraining and cross-map evaluation | `ppo_lap_completion_pretrain.yaml` |
| PPO transfer or matched scratch | `ppo_lap_completion_transfer.yaml` |
| PPO map curriculum | `ppo_lap_completion_curriculum.yaml` |
| PPO pursuit with optional traffic | `ppo_1v1_racing_mpc_circle.yaml` |
| Continuous MAPPO driving; scratch/pretrained/LoRA | `mappo_2v2_continuous.yaml` |
| Finite MAPPO races; reward, critic, penalty and initialization choices | `mappo_2v2_race.yaml` |
| MAPPO asymmetric progress/support; independent full actors or per-agent LoRA | `mappo_2v2_asymmetric.yaml`, `mappo_2v2_asymmetric_lora.yaml` |
| Two-team self-play and optional recording | `mappo_2v2_selfplay.yaml` |
| Circle convergence ablation | `experiments/ppo_combined_slip_circle_stable.yaml` |
| Historical workflows and fixed-controller calibration | `legacy/`, `calibration/`, `render/` |

Use `--pretrained-actor outputs/PRETRAIN_RUN` for PPO-to-MAPPO initialization;
omit it for scratch. Evaluation cadence is configured inline in each workflow. Set `experiment.evaluation_only: true` for the commented held-out evaluation choices; these require `--eval`.

MAPPO's individual arm uses per-agent rewards and an agent-conditioned critic,
`V_i(s)`. The team arm uses a configured team reward reduction and shared team
critic, `V(s)`. Actors use local observations in both modes. Raw shaped rewards
across these arms are not interchangeable evaluation scores.

The pretraining scenario currently uses `L_map` for both train and evaluation;
it does not measure generalization to held-out maps. The `complete_4` experiment
has explicit disjoint splits. See [actor transfer](docs/PPO_TO_MAPPO_PRETRAINING.md),
[duration calibration](docs/RACE_DURATION_CALIBRATION.md), and
[performance checks](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for their respective workflows.
Seed and opponent comparison sweeps are described in [sweeps/README.md](sweeps/README.md).

For headless PPO on multiple CPU cores, use `--num-envs 8 --torch-threads 1`
with one GPU. Single-environment training remains the default. See
[HPC collection and reproducibility](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#headless-ppo-on-hpc)
for allocation, rollout-size, seed, and evaluation details.

PPO and MAPPO share advantage calculation, minibatch loss/optimizer steps, and
metric reduction in `src/agents/common/__init__.py`. Each agent retains its own
rollout storage, minibatch selection, and critic inputs.
Curriculum uses `src/training/curriculum.py`; logging uses training hooks,
`ConsoleLogger`, and the CSV/W&B loggers. Unused alternate curriculum, metrics,
console, and checkpoint utilities were retired from `src/` and remain available
at Git revision `cfd19fb20cf4762dccaa1613bcb3ec7487ee461c`.

Keep changes small and prefer reusing existing files. `run.py` stays the single
training entry point. To implement another trainable algorithm later:

1. Implement it under `src/agents/<algorithm>/`, reusing `agents/common` where appropriate.
2. Declare its supported role in `src/core/agent_builder.py` and validation in
   `src/core/scenario.py`; unsupported names must fail instead of changing roles.
3. Construct it from `run.py`. Reuse a trainer only when its collection/update
   contract fits; add replay or discrete-action support when the implementation needs it.
4. Integrate deterministic evaluation, checkpoint metadata, explicit seeds, and
   complete per-agent dataset transitions. Add a scenario and focused contract tests.

For another fixed opponent, use the existing `AgentFactory` adapter pattern in
`src/core/config.py` and `HEURISTIC_ALGOS` in `src/core/agent_builder.py`.
Preserve environment contracts, action bounds, observation dimensions, reward
semantics, and MAPPO's decentralized actors. No additional controller framework,
plugin system, or placeholder algorithm infrastructure is needed.

The existing nonlinear physics now uses `combined_slip_st` version 2 with a
planar MF6.1 force kernel, load-dependent combined slip, simultaneous load
transfer, and independent first-order wheel/steering actuators. The former
reduced friction-circle implementation has been replaced. Legacy physics remains
available for existing legacy scenarios. Parameters are synthetic and explicitly
uncalibrated; see [physics details and limitations](docs/PHYSICS_MODEL.md).

The HPC parameter choice in `scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_pretrain.yaml` configures the paper's
120-million-transition budget, 400 environments, and 1,024 transitions per worker
per rollout. It uses 50 vehicle/Frenet/track values with fixed track scales across maps, wheel-reference
acceleration, 0.05 s decisions, and episode friction randomization (relative
standard deviation 0.02). Reward is signed distance progress in metres, replaced
by -1 on a geometric boundary violation. Training resets only at that boundary;
lap crossings do not end an episode. Rollouts continue across resets.

Learning-rate decay, periodic checkpoints, and evaluation use transition counts.
Evaluation measures 20 laps with nominal grip and permits excursions to measure
off-track error. Selection uses eight starts and the final protocol uses 20 independent starts
on the same map. `final_model.pt` contains the final update; `best_model.pt` uses
the documented lap-time selection rule. Duplicate `_frenet` and
`_combined_slip` pretraining entry points have been removed.
For local development use `scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_pretrain.yaml` with `--num-envs 1 --num-workers 1 --rollout-steps-per-env 1024`.
For a smaller parallel experiment, pass `--rollout-steps-per-env 1024` to set
pooled `params.n_steps = num_envs * 1024`. Both PPO and MAPPO accept
`--num-workers` to group environments into fewer processes. See
[collector performance](docs/COLLECTOR_PERFORMANCE.md) for the 128-core setup,
optional readiness-based scheduling, and a fixed-budget benchmark.

Edit vehicle parameters in the scenario's inline `environment.vehicle_params` block.
The component reference in `configs/vehicle/combined_slip.yaml` does not override
a standalone scenario. They remain uncalibrated, and observation maxima
and N=20 remain provisional. `L_map` matches the reported dimensions but is an
approximation. See [physics and protocol details](docs/PHYSICS_MODEL.md) for the
remaining reproduction limits. No result on this map establishes sim-to-real
performance. Configure all three map bundle lists when changing tracks.
The separate `ppo_lap_completion_pretrain.yaml` tests collision and boundary
termination on L_map, circle_map, and Budapest_map; evaluation reports contain
per-map summaries. Fixed track scaling changes observation semantics and requires
fresh pretraining. See [the current workflow](docs/PPO_TO_MAPPO_PRETRAINING.md)
for matched scratch comparisons, independent seeds, and acceptance criteria.

For L-first training that automatically adds maps after five clean laps and
checks retention across the full bundle, see [the map curriculum workflow](docs/PPO_MAP_CURRICULUM.md).
Its entry point is `scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_curriculum.yaml`.

Use the independent final evaluation seeds after selecting a checkpoint:

```bash
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/ppo_lap_completion_pretrain.yaml --eval --checkpoint outputs/YOUR_PRETRAIN_RUN --eval-protocol final --output-dir outputs/mf61_final --no-wandb
```

Replace the run directory with one produced by the same scenario and physics
contract. Final seeds use the configured evaluation track and do not establish
sim-to-real performance. The migrated `mappo_2v2_race.yaml` supports the new actor
with 18 appended neighbor/team inputs initialized to zero weight. Other legacy MAPPO
scenarios still need compatible physics/observation/action configurations.

For the circle convergence experiment, use
`scenarios/experiments/ppo_combined_slip_circle_stable.yaml` with the same `run.py` command.
It preserves the three-lap task, observations, physical actions, spawn protocol,
and tires. It reduces the time cost from 0.1 to 0.01 per simulated second,
lowers the initial learning rate to 1e-4, uses four epochs and 256-decision
minibatches, and stops further minibatches when sampled KL exceeds 0.01.
Discount and GAE horizons are approximately 20 s and 5 s. Initial Gaussian
log standard deviation is -0.5 and the entropy coefficient is 0.001.
These are experimental settings, not evidence of convergence. Compare
deterministic completion/progress and finish time at matched decision budgets;
raw rewards are not comparable to the original reward configuration.

PPO's optional `min_rollout_steps: 2048` pools independently bootstrapped
fragments across short episodes and parallel collector rounds while the actor
stays frozen. Episode boundaries still stop GAE. The last partial pool is
updated at training shutdown, so the final update may be smaller. Without this
option the historical immediate fragment-update behavior remains available.
The threshold is checked after each fragment/collector round, so a pooled
update may exceed `min_rollout_steps` by the size of the final collected group.
Metrics include rollout size, optimizer steps, KL early stopping, Gaussian
standard deviation, and action saturation. For circle fine-tuning, pass a
compatible combined-slip checkpoint with `--checkpoint` to this circle scenario;
the optimizer/schedule restart, while the checkpoint's learned standard deviation
overrides `log_std_init`. The transfer YAML targets circle_map.

PPO and MAPPO now retain pre-tanh action samples internally to score saturated
actions correctly and use the entropy of the squashed Gaussian (32-point
quadrature). The Gaussian KL estimate uses `mean(exp(log_ratio)-1-log_ratio)`.
Observation/action dimensions, deterministic inference, checkpoint parameter
layouts, and dataset schemas are unchanged. These training behavior changes
are recorded in provenance; older evaluation checkpoints require the existing
explicit provenance-mismatch override. Historical training curves must be
identified by code revision, even when using the original scenario YAML.

Lap counting cancels backward passages through the finite finish segment before
granting another forward lap. Local loops and reversing across the line cannot
earn extra laps; `count_initial_crossing_as_lap` still controls the first valid
forward crossing. Finish segments must span the drivable track width. With
`completion_progress` selection, earned progress breaks ties while some races
remain incomplete. Once every evaluation race finishes, safety and finish time
determine the best checkpoint, ignoring finish-line overshoot. These behavior
changes are recorded in run provenance. Re-evaluate older checkpoints before
comparing completion rates or selected-model lap times across this change;
`--eval --allow-provenance-mismatch` explicitly acknowledges the changed behavior
when loading an older checkpoint for evaluation.

For parallel PPO in this repository, `n_steps` is the **pooled collection-round** limit:
`steps_per_worker = n_steps / num_envs`. With episode budgets, episode ends flush
shorter fragments, so without `min_rollout_steps` the actual update size can be
smaller. Transition budgets keep collecting across resets. At a 0.01 s decision interval,
`n_steps=2048` gives at most 20.48 s per worker with one environment, 5.12 s with
four, and 2.56 s with eight. More workers at fixed `n_steps` therefore shorten
the sampled GAE trajectories and increase dependence on critic bootstrapping.
To preserve the fragment horizon, scale `n_steps` proportionally to `num_envs`;
this also increases the pooled batch and changes update frequency. Compare runs
at matched environment-decision budgets as well as wall time: episode budgets
and episode-based learning-rate decay do not guarantee equal samples.

Related wrapper classes share modules: rewards use `motion.py`, `completion.py`,
`events.py`, and `interaction.py`; observations use `ego.py`, `track.py`, and
`neighbors.py`. Action components and their composer live in
`src/wrappers/actions/composer.py`. Add related components to these modules while
keeping each component's configuration key, observation slice, and reset behavior
explicit. Reward and observation composers retain their existing import paths.

Scenario reward settings live inline under `agents.<id>.reward`. Component
references remain under `configs/reward/` and `configs/reward/tasks/`. Task files may include one complete
shared preset; task-specific settings are written directly in their `reward:`
block. Avoid separate files for individual penalty or bonus values. Canonical
scenario paths are listed above; former scenario variants are commented parameter choices. The 30 former component fragments
and the previous Python module layout are available in Git history; external
scripts importing moved component classes must use the grouped modules above.

Reusable component configuration still supports the recursive
YAML loader, `core.scenario.load_yaml_config`, with later includes and local
settings taking precedence. `load_and_expand_scenario` remains the entry point;
it validates the configuration and resolves targets without obsolete preset
expansion passes. Configure evaluation in scenario YAMLs. The unused legacy
files under `configs/evaluation/`, protocol interfaces, factory test runner,
logger methods, and output-directory helpers are retained in Git history.
Factory checks now run with the regular readiness tests. Current logging uses
training hooks, `CSVLogger.log_training_episode`, and `WandbLogger.log_metrics`.

## Historical algorithms

SAC, TD3, DQN, and the A2C/DDPG/QR-DQN/TQC compatibility configurations were retired
from the active tree. Their source, scenarios, sweeps, and obsolete distributed
replay documentation are preserved at Git revision
`7c13266d109a797b202f1f22d5606ecb0f7f9851`.
Use a separate historical checkout to inspect or reproduce those runs:

```bash
git worktree add --detach ../F110_MARL-legacy 7c13266d109a797b202f1f22d5606ecb0f7f9851
```

Those names did not all identify distinct implementations: A2C used PPO, DDPG and
TQC configurations used SAC, and QR-DQN configurations used DQN. Historical
algorithm labels should be interpreted accordingly.

## Validation and remaining correctness work

```bash
venv/bin/python -m compileall -q run.py src tests
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/legacy/ppo.yaml --no-wandb --episodes 1 --quiet
PYGLET_HEADLESS=true venv/bin/python run.py --scenario scenarios/legacy/mappo_gaplock.yaml --no-wandb --episodes 1 --quiet
rg "stable_baselines3|from gymnasium|from pettingzoo" run.py src configs scenarios
```

The dependency guard should produce no matches. Contract tests also check retained
scenario resources, invalid algorithm/role combinations, and sweep CLI arguments.
Before cleanup the suite had 147 passes and one scan-isolation failure caused by a
scenario-dependent map fixture; that fixture now declares its own distinct maps.

The follow-up correctness fixes reset fixed opponents in PPO/MAPPO training,
including FTG steering and cutback history and the hybrid controller's FTG state.
Checkpoint-selection evaluation now ends an action repeat when any acting agent
terminates, matching training and CLI evaluation.

An explicit `env.reset(seed=...)` restarts the map scheduler from its configured
order and reseeds its RNG. Unseeded resets continue the existing cycle. Evaluation
uses `reset(seed=base_seed + episode, options={"map_episode_index": episode})`:
the index advances that seeded schedule before selecting the map, preserving
multi-map coverage without depending on sizing resets or earlier evaluations.
The index must be nonnegative and requires an explicit seed.

Dataset directories must be absent or empty. The writer reserves the directory
immediately with `metadata.json` (`complete: false`) and sets `complete: true`
only after successful close. Existing datasets cannot be resumed or overwritten;
use a new directory for each run. Chunk files are also created exclusively.
The array schema remains `2.0`. New `run.py` datasets record
`transition_contract.version: "1.0"`, with `global_state: pre_decision` and
`lifecycle_fields: post_decision`. Both PPO and MAPPO now pair `obs_t` with `s_t`.
Older datasets without this metadata retain their historical semantics: PPO
recorded `s_{t+1}`, while MAPPO recorded `s_t`; do not mix them without an explicit
conversion. A first state cannot generally be recovered from old PPO recordings.

Run provenance now includes `behavior_contracts` for opponent resets, seeded map
scheduling, and evaluation action-repeat boundaries. Checkpoints with older
provenance require `--allow-provenance-mismatch` for intentional reevaluation
under the corrected behavior. These fixes can change trajectories, baseline
scores, and selected checkpoints, so regenerate matched baseline/evaluation runs
before comparing new results with historical experiments. Observation dimensions,
action bounds, reward definitions, and decentralized actor inputs are unchanged.

## Asymmetric progress/support comparison

`scenarios/mappo_2v2_asymmetric.yaml` trains independent full actors for `car_0`
(progress) and `car_1` (support/blocking), with one agent-conditioned centralized
critic. `scenarios/mappo_2v2_asymmetric_lora.yaml` freezes the common pretrained base and
trains separate rank-4 adapters and exploration parameters for those same roles.
Both opponents, `car_2` and `car_3`, use fixed racing MPC controllers.

Use the **same compatible pretrained actor checkpoint** for both arms; both require
it. The configured source is `outputs/asym/best_model.pt`, the earlier shared
MAPPO actor. Its weights seed both independent actors or the frozen LoRA base;
the critic and optimizer start fresh. A compatible PPO checkpoint also works.
This is matched fine-tuning from that source, not a from-scratch comparison.
Physics, action processing, observation prefix and actor architecture must match. The existing 158-input PPO driving policy is extended to 192 inputs with
zero-initialized neighbor/identity columns. Keep seeds, environment/worker counts,
rollout sizes, training budget and evaluation protocol identical across arms.

```bash
python3 run.py --scenario scenarios/mappo_2v2_asymmetric.yaml \
  --pretrained-actor outputs/YOUR_SOURCE_RUN
python3 run.py --scenario scenarios/mappo_2v2_asymmetric_lora.yaml \
  --pretrained-actor outputs/YOUR_SOURCE_RUN
```

`car_0` retains its signed metre-progress/boundary reward. `car_1` receives 0.2×
its own metre progress (boundary penalty remains −1), 1× teammate metre progress,
and a local blocking term: the teammate's signed progress advantage over active
opponents 0.6–6 m behind the blocker, within a 0.6 m lateral corridor, divided by
the number of opponents. Blocking credit requires a forward-moving teammate and
non-reversing blocker. Terminated/out-of-bounds cars do not generate support
bonuses; proximity alone earns none. Separately, `car_1` receives +1 for each
opponent's collision (including a respawn), once per opponent per episode, regardless of
who caused it. Mutual crashes also earn this bonus, while the blocker still
receives −5 for its own collision. These are configurable
starting weights; the local advantage term measures an outcome, not causation.

In both asymmetric training arms and playback, every car respawns from rest at
its nearest clear centerline position after a boundary violation. The learner
boundary cost is charged once on that step. MPC collisions respawn the opponent
half a lap ahead of the active race leader (completed laps, then position from
the finish line), with clearance from other cars. Learner collisions still end
that learner's race. Respawns preserve completed laps, award no teleport progress,
and reset action/controller memory. Recovery counts are separate from terminal
DNFs; the crash bonus remains capped at once per opponent per episode.

Training uses finite three-lap races with a 16,000-step horizon, resetting when
both learners terminate; evaluation waits for all cars or the timeout. Returns
and advantage normalization remain separate per learner. Checkpoint selection
prioritizes `car_0` completion, then finishing ahead of both opponents, then fewer
learner collisions, then `car_0` finish time (if all races completed) or net progress.
It does not require the blocker to finish before recognizing the racer's success.

Each full-training checkpoint contains `actors.car_0`, `actors.car_1`, `critic`,
optimizer state and routing metadata. LoRA checkpoints contain the complete frozen
base, both adapters/exploration vectors, critic and optimizer, so evaluation does
not need the original source file. Historical shared-actor asymmetric checkpoints
are a different baseline: they can initialize both arms through `--pretrained-actor`,
but cannot be loaded directly as independent actors with `--eval --checkpoint`.

To watch either trained arm, use its matching scenario on a graphical desktop:

```bash
env -u PYGLET_HEADLESS python3 run.py \
  --scenario scenarios/mappo_2v2_asymmetric.yaml \
  --eval --checkpoint outputs/YOUR_FULL_RUN --render --num-envs 1 \
  --eval-episodes 5 --allow-provenance-mismatch --no-wandb
```

For LoRA, substitute `scenarios/mappo_2v2_asymmetric_lora.yaml` and its run path.
A run directory selects `best_model.pt`. `scenarios/render/mappo_2v2_asymmetric.yaml`
is also available for independent-actor playback with CPU inference and rendering
on by default. The provenance override permits intentional playback changes;
physics, observation, action and actor-routing checks still apply. Use the matching
training scenario with `--eval-protocol final` for final reporting. Match rank,
alpha and other overrides when evaluating a non-default LoRA run.
